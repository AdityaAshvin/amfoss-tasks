we take number of candles on a cake as input. in next line we take the heights of the candle. "When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones. Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out. 
For example, if your niece is turning  years old, and the cake will have  candles of height she will be able to blow out  candles successfully, since the tallest candles are of height  and there are  such candles.
