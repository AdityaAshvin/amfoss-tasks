### in the problem 1A: 
Firstly, take three positve integers as the input. Then find the number of flagstones needed row-wise and then the number of flagstones needed column-wise. Then we find the total number of flagstones needed by multipying row-wise and column-wise flagstones required.

### in problem 71A:
Taking an input as intger to input the number of words to be given by the user.Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.
This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters.
 
### in problem 158A:
we input two integers n and k and then make the program using this condition "Contestant who earns a score equal to or greater than the k-th place finisher's score will advance to the next round, as long as the contestant earns a positive score..."

### in problem 282A:
using this logic,, "The language is that peculiar as it has exactly one variable, called x. Also, there are two operations:
• Operation ++ increases the value of variable x by 1. 
• Operation -- decreases the value of variable x by 1."
i prepared a python program.

### in problem 96A:
took a input as a string containing 0 and 1. Then checked for the occurence of seven consecutive 0 or 1 using the .find() command. If the condition is satisfied "yes" is printed otherwise "no" is printed.


These were the implementation of the codeforces problem.
