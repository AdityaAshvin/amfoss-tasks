## why must you choose me?
> I am really interested in computers. i have learned the basics of java,c++ and recently learned python.I am a fast learner and little mentorship will really help me a lot to improve my skills. my only weakness i feel is having lack of face to face communication skills.i would like to improve it by joining the club and interact with people of the same mentality.

## how i was before and how i am now?
> This one month of spending time on doing tasks changed me a lot.I would be thinking of a particular task in my mind the whole day, or even days together untill i solved it. I kept trying and trying. I also learnt many new stuffs. I learnt about gitHub,CS50 and many more

## comments and suggestions regarding the selection process
> the tasks are well planned, even a person having no computer science background can do the tasks.

## what is my plan for the next 6 months? 
> If i get into the club then i'll do the work assigned to me or do something that improves my skill. if i dont get into the club then i'll focus on getting a good cgpa. Thats all that i am thinking at the moment.

## how would i contribute back to the club?
> i would do the work assigned to me. i would also like to share my knowledge with others and learn from them as well.
